"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a sniffy voice."Brilliant," said Hermione."But what can we --" 

Hermione gasped."Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately."Don't play," said Hermione at once."Erm --" 

"A bit," said Hermione timidly."Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.""Go_to_Madam_Pomfrey," Hermione suggested."Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me," said Hermione."Granger, Hermione!""Hagrid," said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?""Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around."He's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione."Hermione!""Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?""Hermione, the exams are ages away.""Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something," 

snapped Ron."Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday," said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant."I almost told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percy -- he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this.""I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look.""I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?""I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione."I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every_Flavor_Beans he'd gotten from Hermione."I've just thought -- Hermione.""I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione."If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark_Force spell --" 

"There's still Fluffy, though," said Hermione."It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him."It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all."It's the full Body-Bind," said Hermione miserably."It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione."Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione."Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said Hermione."Just one," said Hermione."Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.""Lucky_you_pay_attention in Herbology, Hermione," said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face."Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry."NOF_Harry and Hermione shouted."No, no, no," said Hermione."Not_if_I can help it," said Hermione grimly."Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor_Mortis," Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve."Of course not," said Hermione briskly."Of course not," said Hermione."Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here," said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice."Oh, move over," Hermione snarled."Positive," said Hermione."Pretend to break your leg," Hermione suggested."Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it."Sit down," he snapped at Hermione."Ten weeks," Hermione snapped."That was far easier than I thought it would be," said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds."These birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said Hermione."Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione."Want to go first, Hermione?""We just want to know who Nicolas_Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione."We want to see Professor_Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought."We'd noticed," said Hermione faintly."We're coming," said Hermione."Well, " Hermione exploded, "if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible -- you could have been killed.""Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle.""Well, I got back all right," said Hermione."You all right, Hermione?""You sound like Hermione.""You're right Harry," said Hermione in a small voice."You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap.A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.All right, Harry, Hermione?"And she let Ron and Hermione in.As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione.At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.But from that moment on, Hermione_Granger became their friend.By the end of the lesson, only Hermione_Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.By the end of the lesson, only Hermione_Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor_McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.Come on, Hermione!"Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse.Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep."Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak.Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer.Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped.Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's tail," when the portrait of the Fat_Lady swung open and Hermione came in.Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate_Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas.Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was.Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again.Harry turned to Hermione.Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed.Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word.He heard Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside.He ignored Hermione's hand.He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.He put on a high voice, "'Oh_Professor_Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'“ 

"Oh, shut up," said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.He turned to Hermione.He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione_Granger this time.He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel.He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.... 

Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test.He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.Hermione and Neville were suffering, too.Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears.Hermione cried, wringing her hands.Hermione did a sort of jig.Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon.Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her.Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too.Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.Hermione hung her head.Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.Hermione ignored him.Hermione jumped to her feet.Hermione left.Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.Hermione ordered them.Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.Hermione ran to turn him over.Hermione read the paper several times.Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, "Wingardium Leviosa!"Hermione said anxiously.Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.Hermione squeaked.Hermione stepped forward.Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.Hermione urged Neville.Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them.Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.Hermione was trembling.Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily.Hermione went on.Hermione whispered.Hermione wouldn't hear of it.Hermione's eyes were wide.Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone.Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.Hermione, you'd better do that."Hermione_Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.Hermione_Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.Hermione_Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.Hermione_Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all.Hermione_Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, "I -- told -- you."I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces...." 

Harry_and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think.In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.It was Hermione who spoke first.It was Hermione.It was Hermione_Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.It was Hermione_Granger.It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements.It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question.Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry.Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.No one was talking much except Hermione_Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need.Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione_Granger, by the way, who are you.On Harry's other side, Percy_Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- ").On their way down to the Great_Hall_for_the_Halloween_feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati_Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione_Granger had come in.Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot.Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break.Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great_Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione_Granger.She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side.Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table.The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.The_Fat_Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped.They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me...." 

Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione.This is Harry_Potter_an' Hermione_Granger, by the way.To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger.Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, "That's just the exams.With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.You got Hermione's owl?"asked Hermione.cried Hermione.panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.said Hermione in alarm.said Hermione nervously.said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --" 

"What?said Hermione thoughtfully.said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant.said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.said Hermione.said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.shouted Hermione_Granger.shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.shrieked Hermione.whispered Hermione.
